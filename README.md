# Project 1 ReadMe

## Data Exploration

### 1. Data Set Acquisition
In the initial phase of this project, the team embarked on data exploration. We scoured various online sources, including websites like Kaggle, to locate a suitable dataset for our analysis.

### 2. Data Selection
Selecting an appropriate dataset posed a significant challenge. Our primary goal was to find data that aligned with the assignment's requirements. We aimed to choose a dataset that was both engaging and pertinent to the project's scope. We specifically looked for a dataset with manageable size, containing numeric data, and offering insights that could be tested. Our focus was on topics related to entertainment or popular culture.

### 3. Data Cleaning
After importing the dataset, a critical step was to clean the data. This included preparing the columns for data analysis, which involved tasks such as removing unnecessary words, filling in missing data points, and identifying and addressing null values. A particular challenge was the separation of dates, which proved to be more complex than initially anticipated.

## Final Data Analysis

### 1. Hypothesis Testing
Following the data cleaning process, we conducted a hypothesis test. The test, specifically an ANOVA test, led to the rejection of the null hypothesis due to the low p-value. This outcome indicated that the number of episodes did not significantly impact the score of the anime, based on the dataset. This result raised questions about how the scores were determined, such as whether they were assigned after the show's completion, during publication, or episode by episode.
